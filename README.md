# 200 Coding Interview Questions: Basic to Intermediate in TypeScript

This repository contains solutions to 200 common coding interview questions, ranging from basic to intermediate difficulty, implemented in **TypeScript**. The goal of this project is to help developers strengthen their problem-solving skills and understanding of TypeScript, especially if they are already familiar with **JavaScript**. Since TypeScript builds upon JavaScript, transitioning to it is seamless, and this collection aims to reinforce core concepts while demonstrating the added benefits of TypeScript like static typing and interfaces.

### Why TypeScript?
TypeScript enhances JavaScript by introducing type safety, improved tooling, and clearer, more maintainable code. If you know JavaScript, you'll find it easy to write TypeScript, and this project serves as a practical guide to improve both your TypeScript skills and your coding problem-solving abilities.

### Topics Covered:
- Data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, etc.)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, etc.)
- Recursion and backtracking
- Problem-solving patterns
- And more...

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the problem folder and explore individual solutions.
3. Each solution is written with detailed comments to explain the logic and approach used.

Feel free to contribute, improve solutions, or suggest additional problems!
